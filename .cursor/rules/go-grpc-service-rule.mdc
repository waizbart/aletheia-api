When working with gRPC services in Go:

- Define your Protocol Buffer messages and service.
- Generate Go code from the Proto file using `protoc`.
- Implement the gRPC server in Go, handling requests and responses.
- Handle errors properly and implement proper validation.
- Use appropriate gRPC status codes and error handling patterns.
- For database interactions, follow the guidelines in `database-interaction-best-practices.mdc`.
- Consider implementing interceptors for cross-cutting concerns (logging, authentication, tracing).
- Follow gRPC best practices for streaming, deadlines, and cancellation.
